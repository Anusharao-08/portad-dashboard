# Engineering Workflow

## Local setup
Use Node.js 22 LTS (Node 20.9+ is the documented minimum) and npm.

    npm ci
    npm run dev
    npm test
    npm run lint
    npm run build

Use .env.example as a reference and create .env.local only for local values. Never commit real credentials or production data.

## Branches and commits
Use short-lived branches with descriptive prefixes: feat/name, fix/name, docs/name, test/name, or chore/name. Use conventional-style commit messages where practical: feat, fix, docs, test, chore, or refactor. Keep each commit focused.

## Issue quality
Each issue should include the problem and user impact, scope and non-goals, numbered acceptance criteria, relevant route/component and reproduction steps, test expectations, dependencies, and a mentor/reviewer when the contributor is new. Avoid assigning work before the task is Ready.

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] The PR links the issue and explains motivation.
- [ ] Scope is focused; no unrelated formatting or generated files.
- [ ] npm test, npm run lint, and npm run build pass, or exceptions are explained.
- [ ] User-visible states, errors, loading, and empty states are covered.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation, semantic labels, focus, contrast, and reduced motion were considered.
- [ ] Responsive layout was checked for UI changes.
- [ ] Docs, environment examples, and screenshots are updated when needed.
- [ ] No credentials, personal data, or private logs are included.
- [ ] Reviewer feedback is resolved or explicitly discussed.

## Testing strategy
- **Unit/component:** pure logic, rendering, state changes, validation, accessibility attributes.
- **Integration:** components working with API/auth boundaries, including errors and empty results.
- **End-to-end:** critical user journeys such as route navigation and wizard progression.
- **Manual smoke test:** desktop/mobile layout and keyboard interaction for visible UI changes.

Do not claim a check passed unless it was actually run. Include command output or CI links for non-obvious failures.

## CI and dependencies
CI currently runs install, lint, and build. Consider adding npm test to CI after verifying the suite is stable. Review dependency updates for changelog, compatibility, security impact, and lockfile consistency. Overrides must have an owner, justification, and revisit date.

## Release readiness
Before a release, verify acceptance criteria; review high/critical security findings; run tests, lint, build, and critical journey checks; verify docs and compatibility statements; prepare release notes with known limitations; and understand rollback/disablement for backend-connected features.
